# PyBer_Analysis

## Challenge Overview
V. Isualize has tasked you with a new challenge: to create a new dataframe and a new mulitple-line graph. For this challenge you will need to:
- Create a dataframe showing the key metrics of the ride-sharing data by city type
- Create a multiple-line graph showing the average fare for each week by city type
- Summarize the data in the dataframe and multiple-line graph and explain their implications

## Challenge Summary

### Key Metrics by City Type

As we can see in the Key Metrics table above, there is an inverse correlation between the average fare and total rides by city type. In other words, while urban cities have the lowest average fare price, they have an exponentially larger amount of rides than the suburban and rural cities. We could assume that the fare prices in rural cities are higher due to supply-and-demand, however more data would be needed to confirm this. For example, if we had the average distance of each ride, we could determine if the rural fares were higher due to longer-distance rides, which would be more expensive. In summary, while rural cities return higher fare rates, expansion should be focused on urban cities, where the ride volume is so high that the profits would be the greatest.
